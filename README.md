# Postman Usage Instructions

1. **Getting Started:** Open Postman and begin your API interactions.

2. **Authorization:** Ensure that you pass the token as an authorization header in Postman. If your token is, for example, '123456', set the authorization value as 'Token 123456' (with a space between 'Token' and '123456' and without quotes).

3. **Changing Account Details:** When making changes to account details, always use the specific user's token to gain access and make the necessary modifications.

4. **Endpoint Slash:** Remember to include a trailing slash at the end of endpoints. Failure to do so may result in an error message in Postman without a response.
